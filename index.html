Here lies random odds-and-sods I've worked on over the years:

<h2><a href="https://github.com/drtonyr/pis-third-asm-emu">pis-third-asm-emu</a></h2>

I've wanted to build a very simple educational computer for decades, this is the archive of part of those dreams up to 2017.
My current plans are at <a href="https://blinkingcomputer.org">The Blinking Computer</a>.
  
<h2><a href="https://drtonyr.github.io/carbonTaxBackstop">carbonTaxBackstop</a></h2>

A 2019 analyis of UK consumer spending to estimate the effect of a carbon tax which achieved net zero.  The main conclusion is that it's not what we buy, just how much we spend.  Net zero is achievable if (a) those that consume most spend less and (b) we implement soemthing like a universal basic income to make the carbon tax affordable to all.
